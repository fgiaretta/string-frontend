# Deployment Summary for Internal Control Panel

## Deployment Status

The Internal Control Panel has been successfully deployed to AWS CloudFront with the domain panel.string.tec.br. Here's a summary of the resources created:

### S3 Bucket
- **Name**: panel-string-tec-br
- **Website URL**: http://panel-string-tec-br.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
- **Configuration**: Static website hosting enabled with index.html as both index and error document

### SSL Certificate
- **ARN**: arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:759718024884:certificate/fbe993dd-5af3-4b46-af62-98f69e7e06c8
- **Domain**: panel.string.tec.br
- **Status**: Pending validation (DNS validation record has been added)

### CloudFront Distribution
- **ID**: E177OIYXIPJ8PW
- **Domain Name**: d1ao5r4anbx1h6.cloudfront.net
- **Origin**: panel-string-tec-br.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
- **Configuration**: 
  - HTTPS enabled with redirect from HTTP
  - Custom error page for 404 errors (redirects to index.html for SPA routing)
  - Default cache behavior with 1-day TTL

### DNS Configuration
- **Domain**: panel.string.tec.br
- **Record Type**: A record (Alias to CloudFront)
- **Target**: d1ao5r4anbx1h6.cloudfront.net

## Next Steps

1. **Certificate Validation**: The SSL certificate is currently pending validation. This process can take up to 30 minutes to complete. Once validated, the HTTPS connection will be fully functional.

2. **DNS Propagation**: DNS changes may take some time to propagate globally (typically up to 48 hours, though often much faster). During this time, the domain may not be accessible from all locations.

3. **Testing**: Once the certificate is validated and DNS has propagated, visit https://panel.string.tec.br to verify the deployment.

## Maintenance and Updates

To update the application in the future:

1. Build the updated application:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/fgiaretta/codes/string/frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. Upload the new build to S3:
   ```bash
   aws s3 sync dist/ s3://panel-string-tec-br/ --delete --profile fgiaretta
   ```

3. Invalidate the CloudFront cache to ensure visitors see the latest version:
   ```bash
   aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id E177OIYXIPJ8PW --paths "/*" --profile fgiaretta
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the deployment:

1. **Certificate Issues**: Check the certificate status in the AWS Certificate Manager console.
2. **DNS Issues**: Verify the DNS records in Route 53.
3. **Content Issues**: Check the S3 bucket contents and permissions.
4. **CloudFront Issues**: Check the CloudFront distribution status and configuration.
