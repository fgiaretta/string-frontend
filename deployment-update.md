# Deployment Update: Environment Configuration Changes

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Environment Toggle**
   - Removed the environment toggle component from the UI
   - Removed references to the API environment context
   - The application now strictly uses environment variables for API configuration

2. **Updated API Service**
   - Modified `api.ts` to only use the environment variable `VITE_API_URL` for determining the API endpoint
   - Removed the localStorage-based environment switching logic

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Confirmed that `.env.development` points to: https://api-dev.string.tec.br
   - Confirmed that `.env.production` points to: https://api.string.tec.br
   - The default `.env` file points to the development API

## Deployment

The updated application has been:
1. Built for production using `npx vite build`
2. Uploaded to the S3 bucket `panel-string-tec-br`
3. CloudFront cache has been invalidated to ensure the latest version is served

## How It Works Now

- When running in development mode (`npm run dev`), the application will use the development API (api-dev.string.tec.br)
- When built for production (`npm run build`), the application will use the production API (api.string.tec.br)
- There is no longer a way for users to toggle between environments in the UI

## Testing

To test different environments:
- For development: Use `npm run dev` which will use the development API
- For production: Use `npm run build` which will use the production API

## Next Steps

If you need to make changes to the API endpoints:
1. Update the appropriate `.env` file(s)
2. Rebuild the application
3. Deploy to S3
4. Invalidate the CloudFront cache

## CloudFront Distribution Status

The CloudFront distribution is currently being deployed. Once complete, the application will be accessible at:
https://panel.string.tec.br
